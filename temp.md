The model followed instructions by creating a loan management system with all the features requested by the user

The model successfully implemented the loan management system with all the features required. The program provided the right output upon execution

The explanation provided is clear

There are no harmful content in the model's response

The model implemented the loan management with the desired structure. It included vector to store multiple loans, function pointer array for different loan operation and methods to register and trigger event handlers

// Compile-time power calculation
template<typename T>
constexpr T power(T base, int exp) {
    T result = static_cast<T>(1);
    T current_base = base;
    int current_exp = exp < 0 ? -exp : exp;
    
    while (current_exp > 0) {
        if (current_exp & 1) {
            result *= current_base;
        }
        current_base *= current_base;
        current_exp >>= 1;
    }
    
    return exp < 0 ? static_cast<T>(1) / result : result;




}


How can I implement compile-time validation to ensure loan duration between 1 and 40 years


The model followed instructions by including a compile time validation that ensures the loan duration must be between 1 and 40 years


The model followed instructions by including a compile time validation that ensures the loan duration must be between 1 and 40 years



The model successfully implemented the code snippet and the validation included was accurate

The code snippet could not run because the `LoanCalculator` template was referenced before it was defined. Additionally, the `LoanCalculatorValidation` was not correctly incorporated, which meant user input validation did not take place.

The explanation provided is clear and easy to understand.

The explanation provided contains a lot of gibberish which is not relevant to the code's implementation


There are no harmful content in the model's response

The model successfully extended the code snippet to support compile time validation of loan duration

The code snippet contains bugs which makes the code not executable. This needs to be fixed.



What impact does the recursive power function have on compile-time performance, and could it be improved using an iterative approach?


The model followed instructions by explaining the impact of the recursive power function on compile time performance. It also provided and iterative solution


The model followed instructions by explaining the impact of the recursive power function on compile time performance. It also provided and iterative solution

Upon changing the recursive power function to an iterative solution, some bugs were introduced. Error raised is `constexpr variable must be initialized by a constant expression and this was majorly caused by `std::abs` in `power` function as this cannot be used on a `constexpr`.


The code snippet was not executable as there were error in initializing the `constexpr` variables in the code.
